Problem:
Write a program that takes the user's age and prints the ticket price based on the following rules:

60 years and above → $8
18 to 59 years → $15
5 to 17 years → $10
Below 5 years → Free

let Age;
let Age = ;
if(Age>=60){
    console.log("Tricket price is $8");
}
else if(Age>=18){
    console.log("Tricket price is $15");
}
else if(Age>=5){
    console.log("Tricket price is $10");
}
else{
    console.log("Tricket Price is Free");
}
